# PythonExamples
This example illustrates fitting and comparing several Machine Learning algorithms for classifying the binary label 'left' in the Human Resource data set.<br>
The steps include:<br>
PREPARE AND EXPLORE<br>
&nbsp;   a) Data is loaded into CAS <br>
&nbsp;   b) Explore data, distributions, correlations, and visualizations <br>
PERFORM SUPERVISED LEARNING<br>
&nbsp;   a) Fit a model using Logistic Regression <br>
&nbsp;   b) Fit a model using Gradient Boosting <br>
&nbsp;   c) Hands-on Problem - Fit a model using Random Forest <br>
EVALUATE AND IMPLEMENT<br>
&nbsp;   a) Score the data<br>
&nbsp;   b) Assess model performance<br>
&nbsp;   c) Generate ROC and Lift charts <br>
&nbsp;   d) Hands-on Problem - Score, Assess, ROC charts for Random Forest model and Compare with Logistic and Gradient Boosting<br>
